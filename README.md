My Unity project for Ludum Dare 48

For Ludum Dare #48 I made a game mechanic deconstruction of the section in Dark Souls 2, in which you have to jump down a huge hole in the hub area Majula. Your goal is to reach the bottom of the hole by compensating fall damage with your health potions and of course, landing on the right platforms.
